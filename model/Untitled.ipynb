      "(Reuters) - T-Mobile US Inc Chief Executive John Legere testified on Friday that he believes U.S. regulators considered Dish Network’s history of attempting to build a wireless network when they approved the merger between T-Mobile and Sprint Corp. A group of U.S. states have sued to stop the merger, saying it would lead to higher prices.  T-Mobile and Sprint have already received approval for the deal from the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), after the companies agreed to sell Sprint’s prepaid phone business and some spectrum to satellite TV provider Dish, which has committed to building a nationwide wireless network and becoming a competitor in the industry. The states have argued that Dish has a history of stockpiling FCC licenses for wireless spectrum, or airwaves that carry data, and has not yet demonstrated that it can build a wireless network. Legere was the defense’s first witness, and his testimony came on the fifth day of a trial that is expected to run until Dec. 20. He has previously accused Dish of “hoarding” spectrum.  Glenn Pomerantz, an attorney representing California in the lawsuit, asked Legere about a letter T-Mobile previously sent to the FCC, criticizing Dish’s wireless business plans as a “modernized version of last century’s two-way paging.” Legere testified that he believed the FCC considered Dish’s track record when it approved the merger of T-Mobile and Sprint. Under the terms with the FCC, which has given the green light to the T-Mobile and Sprint merger, Dish committed to build a 5G wireless network that will cover at least 70% of the U.S. population by June 2023, or it will pay up to $2.2 billion in fines.

      "(Reuters) - T-Mobile US Inc said on Wednesday it officially completed the $23 billion merger with Sprint Corp, solidifying its position as the No.3 wireless providers in the United States. The deal comes after a long legal battle between multiple state attorneys general which argued that a merger between T-Mobile and Sprint would be anticompetitive.  The combined company will now operate under the T-Mobile name and will trade on the NASDAQ as “TMUS.” The deal also enables T-Mobile and Sprint to join their high-band and low-band spectrum that could allow a faster roll-out of national 5G. Sprint acknowledged risks in an SEC filing, saying that its internal controls over financial reporting could negatively impact the combined company.  A U.S. federal judge approved the deal, which was originally valued at $26 billion, in February, rejecting a claim by a group of states that the proposed transaction would violate antitrust laws and raise prices. The deal closed without a final decision from the California Public Utilities Commission. The CPUC issued a proposed decision in March to approve the merger of T-Mobile and Sprint with conditions and the final decision is slated to come on April 16. T-Mobile and Sprint agreed to abide by any provisions set forth by the California commission. Also, on Wednesday, a federal judge in Washington gave court approval to the Justice Department’s decision to approve the merger. The department had given its approval to the deal in July on condition the combined wireless company sell off assets to Dish Network, making the latter the fourth-largest provider in the U.S. wireless space. The Federal Communications Commission signed off on the deal in October. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai applauded the decision and said that it would boost the U.S. position in the race to 5G. T-Mobile’s long-time Chief Executive John Legere is stepping down from his position effective immediately as part of the deal. Legere was originally set to leave at the end of April, with Mike Sievert, T-Mobile’s president, as his successor. Legere, who helped launched the company’s notable “Un-carrier” strategy, will serve on T-Mobile’s board of directors. T-Mobile shares rose 2.34% on the announcement.

      "April 22 (Reuters) - AT&T Inc’s first-quarter revenue fell short of Wall Street expectations and the company pulled its annual forecast on Wednesday, as the impact of the coronavirus outbreak overshadowed a strong growth in monthly phone subscribers. The U.S. media and telecommunications giant said the pandemic reduced earnings by 5 cents per share. Advertising sales, which was severely hit due to the  postponement of live sports such as March Madness, and lower wireless equipment sales led to a $600 million decline in revenue, AT&T reported. The company said it had limited visibility for the rest of the year, but added that it had enough free cash flow to pay dividends and make debt payments. In the first three months of the year, AT&T added 163,000 net new monthly phone subscribers, beating the average Wall Street estimate of 90,700. AT&T was able to earn more customers despite shutting down more than 40% of its retail stores. The company said that the coronavirus pandemic had a $435 million impact on EBITDA. AT&T lost 897,000 so-called premium TV subscribers, which includes its satellite TV provider DirecTV and a small number of U-Verse users as more consumers cut cords amid the pandemic. WarnerMedia, which suffered the brunt of the impact from the pandemic, reported $7.4 billion in revenue, down from $8.4 billion from a year earlier. The company reported total revenue of $42.8 billion, missing Wall Street expectations of $44.2 billion, according to Refinitiv data. Excluding items, AT&T earned 84 cents per share.

It said on its investor page that the new loan agreement, with five banks, would “provide additional financial flexibility to an already strong cash position.” AT&T spent $85 billion on Time Warner in 2018. It bought satellite TV service DirecTV for $49 billion in 2015, but the unit has continued to bleed customers.

Shares of AT&T fell 8% in midday trade. AT&T said it planned to continue investing in its network and taking care of its employees.  “The impacts of the pandemic could be material, but due to the evolving nature of this situation, we are not able at this time to estimate the impact on our financial or operational results,” AT&T said in the filing.  Washington has sought to stabilize Wall Street with a $1 trillion economic stimulus plan, but some critics think companies should be banned from stock buy backs under the package.  “If there is so much as a dime of corporate bailout money in the next relief package, it should include a reinstated ban on stock buybacks,” Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) said in a tweet on Tuesday.  U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday during a press conference that he would not oppose banning stock repurchases under his administration’s stimulus plan.

      "BOSTON (Reuters) - Activist investors say telecommunications pioneer AT&T Inc will not take their calls for its upcoming annual meeting, reinforcing their concerns that the shift of the gathering to cyberspace due to the COVID-19 pandemic would restrict shareholder input. The activists, including a retired AT&T (T.N) employee and a high-profile private shareholder, both said AT&T rejected their efforts to present proxy resolutions at the April 24 event. The meeting originally was to be held in Dallas and became one of hundreds changed to an online-only format since March to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The activists and several corporate governance specialists said it was the first time they knew of a company barring investors from introducing their resolutions in some manner. AT&T spokesperson Daphne Avila disputed that the company is  barring investors from participating. She said the company is asking proponents of shareholder resolutions - three in total - to provide written comments to be read by management during the meeting.  “This approach will let us efficiently address the matters to be voted and then move on to additional content, specifically the CEO’s state of the business discussion and questions from shareholders,” she said. Like other shareholders, resolution proponents can submit questions ahead of time, she said. “I think they’re looking at this as an opportunity to have a shareholder meeting where they don’t have a lot of pushback,” said Jeff Rechenbach, a retired AT&T employee and union official in Cleveland. He had sponsored a resolution calling for the company to add an employee representative to its board. Shares of AT&T were up 2.1% at $30.80 in Friday trading. AT&T’s event is one of the hundreds of U.S. corporate annual meetings shifted online in an effort to limit public gatherings that could spread the coronavirus. Activists have long complained the online-only formats enable companies to stifle dissent and shareholder activism and limit attention. One is John Chevedden, a prolific filer and backer of shareholder resolutions, including one this year calling on AT&T to have an independent board chair. Like Rechenbach, Chevedden got an email from AT&T on Tuesday indicating he would not have a chance to speak. Chevedden said he has had difficulties at other online meetings this year, including at Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co (GT.O), which cut him off as he spoke, and at Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N), which did not take his questions.    “Companies are trying to take advantage of COVID-19 and silence voices,” Chevedden said. Goodyear and BNY Mellon representatives declined to comment. Guidance issued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as of April 7 notes a rule requiring shareholder proponents or their representatives to appear and present their proposals.  But given the difficulties in attending meetings in person because of COVID-19, the guidance states, companies are encouraged “to provide shareholder proponents or their representatives with the ability to present their proposals through alternative means, such as by phone.” An SEC spokeswoman declined to comment.

      "NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York on Sunday dropped its fight against the $40 billion merger of U.S. wireless carriers T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS.O) and Sprint Corp (S.N), saying the state would not appeal a judge’s approval of the deal.  New York Attorney General Letitia James said her office would end the court challenge to the 2018 merger agreement between the third- and fourth-largest U.S. wireless carriers.  Instead, she said her office hopes “to work with all the parties to ensure that consumers get the best pricing and service possible, that networks are built out throughout our state, and that good-paying jobs are created here in New York.” A U.S. federal judge gave the companies the green light on Tuesday to complete the deal. New York, California and other states had challenged it on antitrust grounds, saying it would drive up prices for consumers. The office of California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said it was reviewing the court ruling and its options. “We are mindful that the California Public Utility Commission also has this matter under consideration,” it said on Sunday.     Attorneys general offices for Connecticut and Massachusetts said they are reviewing the decision and evaluating their options. Michigan said it was not in a position to comment. The eight other states in the group and the District of Columbia did not reply to requests for comment. In her statement, New York’s James said the “process has yielded commitments from T-Mobile to create jobs in Rochester and engage in robust national diversity initiatives that will connect our communities with good jobs and technology.” Other states have also stopped pursing their fight by focusing on jobs they were promised. In October, Colorado became the second state, after Mississippi, to drop its legal challenge after striking an agreement with T-Mobile and Dish Network Corp (DISH.O), which will buy the assets divested from the merger. Dish pledged to bring 2,000 jobs to Colorado, and T-Mobile agreed to deploy the next generation of wireless 5G across much of the state. No further details were immediately available on any such specific agreement with New York.    The all-stock deal was originally valued at $26 billion. With gains in the value of T-Mobile shares since it was announced, the deal is now worth $40 billion.

      "BOSTON (Reuters) - Activist investors say telecommunications pioneer AT&T Inc will not take their calls for its upcoming annual meeting, reinforcing their concerns that the shift of the gathering to cyberspace due to the COVID-19 pandemic would restrict shareholder input. The activists, including a retired AT&T (T.N) employee and a high-profile private shareholder, both said AT&T rejected their efforts to present proxy resolutions at the April 24 event. The meeting originally was to be held in Dallas and became one of hundreds changed to an online-only format since March to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The activists and several corporate governance specialists said it was the first time they knew of a company barring investors from introducing their resolutions in some manner. AT&T spokesperson Daphne Avila disputed that the company is  barring investors from participating. She said the company is asking proponents of shareholder resolutions - three in total - to provide written comments to be read by management during the meeting.  “This approach will let us efficiently address the matters to be voted and then move on to additional content, specifically the CEO’s state of the business discussion and questions from shareholders,” she said. Like other shareholders, resolution proponents can submit questions ahead of time, she said. “I think they’re looking at this as an opportunity to have a shareholder meeting where they don’t have a lot of pushback,” said Jeff Rechenbach, a retired AT&T employee and union official in Cleveland. He had sponsored a resolution calling for the company to add an employee representative to its board. Shares of AT&T were up 2.1% at $30.80 in Friday trading. AT&T’s event is one of the hundreds of U.S. corporate annual meetings shifted online in an effort to limit public gatherings that could spread the coronavirus. Activists have long complained the online-only formats enable companies to stifle dissent and shareholder activism and limit attention. One is John Chevedden, a prolific filer and backer of shareholder resolutions, including one this year calling on AT&T to have an independent board chair. Like Rechenbach, Chevedden got an email from AT&T on Tuesday indicating he would not have a chance to speak. Chevedden said he has had difficulties at other online meetings this year, including at Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co (GT.O), which cut him off as he spoke, and at Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N), which did not take his questions.    “Companies are trying to take advantage of COVID-19 and silence voices,” Chevedden said. Goodyear and BNY Mellon representatives declined to comment. Guidance issued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as of April 7 notes a rule requiring shareholder proponents or their representatives to appear and present their proposals.  But given the difficulties in attending meetings in person because of COVID-19, the guidance states, companies are encouraged “to provide shareholder proponents or their representatives with the ability to present their proposals through alternative means, such as by phone.” An SEC spokeswoman declined to comment.

      "(Reuters) - AT&T Inc (T.N) said on Tuesday it was shutting its DirecTV subscription access to Venezuela due to U.S. sanctions, cutting off a key source of entertainment for millions of people stuck in their homes under a strict coronavirus quarantine.  DirecTV was the country’s most popular television service, providing a range of foreign channels as alternatives to the country’s beleaguered local television industry that has been battered by a hyperinflationary economic crisis.  U.S. sanctions meant to force President Nicolas Maduro from office prohibit companies from contracting with state agencies, but local Venezuelan laws require subscription services to carry channels run by the government. “Because it is impossible for AT&T’s DIRECTV unit to comply with the legal requirements of both countries, AT&T was forced to close its pay TV operations in Venezuela,” the company said in a statement.  Venezuela’s information ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment.  Some users reported seeing their screens go blank, while others said they continued to receive foreign channels but no local ones. It was not immediately evident how long it would take for the closure to take effect. DirecTV has for years been a mainstay of poor neighborhoods in Venezuela, where the company’s antennas were often visible on the zinc roofs of low-income cinder-block houses. “I don’t like these Venezuelan channels, it’s all politics,” said Aura Leon, a homemaker in Catia, a working class area of Caracas. “I called my son ... and he told me what was happening, that DirecTV wasn’t going to exist anymore, and I was in shock.” Reporting by Neha Malara in Bengaluru, Efrain Otero and Brian Ellsworth in Caracas; Editing by Arun Koyyur and Matthew Lewis\n",

      "BOSTON (Reuters) - T. Rowe Price Group Inc said on Thursday it would ratchet up the risk in its target-date retirement portfolios, boosting stock allocations to as much as 98% for younger investors.      Target-date funds are popular in 401(k) plans because they do the work of allocating worker and employer retirement contributions into stocks and bonds. Funds with distant retirement dates typically allocate about 90% of their portfolios to stocks, with that percentage declining as retirement nears. T. Rowe, which manages $292 billion in active target-date portfolios, said it would hold the 98% allocation constant until investors are 35 years from retirement. Currently, the T. Rowe Price 2060 fund has about 89% of its assets in stocks.  The company also said it would boost stock allocations for investors in their retirement years. The final allocation, 30 years past retirement, would be 30% stocks, up from the current level of 20%, the company said. The transition will happen over a two-year period starting in April. Portfolios closest to retirement will not experience an increase in stock allocations from current levels, the company said in a statement. Assets in target-date portfolios have been growing at a rapid clip since the 2007-2009 recession, surging to more than $1.7 trillion at the end of 2018, from investor deposits and stock market gains, according to research firm Morningstar Inc. Vanguard Group dominates the target-date market with nearly 40% market share in mutual fund portfolios, followed by 19% at Fidelity Investments and 13% at T.

      "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - California’s Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) voted on Thursday to approve the merger of wireless carriers T-Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp, marking the final approval for a $23 billion deal which closed on April 1. The deal had closed without a final decision from the California PUC, which gave that on Thursday with a unanimous vote. The CPUC had issued a proposed decision in March to approve the merger with conditions. T-Mobile and Sprint agreed to abide by those conditions. The biggest hurdle for the companies was a legal battle with state attorneys general who had argued that the deal would mean higher prices for consumers. But a U.S. federal judge disagreed in February, and allowed the deal, which was originally valued at $26 billion, to go forward. In comments before the vote, two of the commissioners noted the importance of ensuring that conditions that T-Mobile agreed to in order to win the approval be adequately enforced. The combined company now operates under the T-Mobile name and will trade on the NASDAQ as “TMUS.” The deal is designed to enable the combined company to join their high-band and low-band spectrum that could allow a faster roll-out of national 5G. The Justice Department and Federal Communications Commission signed off on the merger last year. The department had given its approval to the deal in July on condition the combined wireless company sell off assets to Dish Network, making the latter the fourth-largest provider in the U.S. wireless space.

California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, whose state worked with New York and others, said the states would not appeal a loss in a federal court in New York in February. “Today’s settlement locks in new jobs and protections for vulnerable consumers, and it extends access to telecom services for our most underserved and rural communities,” Becerra said in a statement on Wednesday. Separately on Wednesday, an administrative judge with the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) issued a decision approving the proposed merger on condition the companies meet milestones: for example, giving nearly all of California 5G networks by the end of 2026, with download speeds of at least 100 megabits per second. The CPUC is scheduled to make a final decision on April 16. California, Washington, D.C., and other states that fought the deal will be reimbursed for up to $15 million in litigation costs and receive enforceable commitments on pricing and job protections, Becerra’s office said. The companies agreed to offer all the plans that T-Mobile had in place in February 2019, or better, to residents of the plaintiff states for five years, according to a copy of the signing document seen by Reuters. New T-Mobile has committed to offering residents of the plaintiff states two low-cost plans for at least five years, including one for $25 per month with 5 gigabytes of high-speed data. The merged company agreed to offer all of T-Mobile and Sprint’s retail employees in good standing in the plaintiff states substantially similar employment. The plaintiff states involved in the settlement are California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Washington, D.C., and Wisconsin. “While I would have preferred this megamerger not to move forward, I am pleased to have secured significant concessions for Connecticut consumers to lock in rates and protect Connecticut jobs,” Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said in a statement. New York had previously said it would not appeal and was not part of the settlement. The U.S. Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission signed off on the merger last year after the companies agreed to divest Sprint’s prepaid businesses, including Boost Mobile, to satellite television company Dish Network Corp (DISH.O), and give it access to 20,000 cell sites and hundreds of retail locations.

      "(Reuters) - T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS.O) on Monday beat analysts’ third-quarter estimates for net new phone subscribers who pay a monthly bill, boosted by competitive wireless plans aimed at fending off its bigger rivals. The third-largest U.S. wireless carrier by subscribers has been locked in a lengthy battle to close its merger with smaller carrier Sprint Corp (S.N). It faces a state attorneys general lawsuit, led by New York and California and set to go to trial on Dec. 9, that alleges the merger would be harmful to consumers. T-Mobile Chief Executive John Legere, speaking on a conference call with analysts, said discussions were continuing with the attorneys general and he felt good about where they were headed “either in settlement or going to trial.” Legere said T-Mobile expects it will be permitted to close the merger in early 2020.  The carrier added 754,000 phone subscribers who pay a monthly bill on a net basis in the three months ended Sept. 30, compared with 774,000 additions a year earlier. Analysts had expected 742,600 new postpaid phone subscribers, according to research firm FactSet. Investors pay close attention to postpaid customers, or those with a recurring bill, because they are more valuable to carriers and tend to remain with the company longer than prepaid users.   T-Mobile customer growth in quarters: here Legere also teased an announcement on Nov. 7 related to New T-Mobile, the name that has been dubbed for the combined T-Mobile and Sprint.  Though Legere provided few details, he said in response to an analyst question that he expected the announcement would answer some of the questions from the states in the merger lawsuit.  Both Verizon and AT&T, which are larger than T-Mobile by subscriber count, beat Wall Street estimates for net new phone subscribers. Bellevue, Washington-based T-Mobile said it expects pre-close merger-related costs to be $125 million to $150 million before taxes in the fourth quarter.  The company said it now targeting adjusted core earnings for 2019 of $13.1 to $13.3 billion, up at the midpoint from prior guidance of $12.9 to $13.3 billion.

      "NEW YORK (Reuters) - T-Mobile US Inc and Sprint Corp did not pursue a merger in order to reduce price competition in the U.S. wireless market, the chief executive of Deutsche Telekom, T-Mobile’s majority shareholder, testified on Tuesday in federal court in Manhattan. A group of state attorneys general, led by New York and California, are suing to stop the $26.5 billion merger between the wireless carriers, arguing it would lead to higher prices. Timotheus Höttges, who is chairman of T-Mobile’s board, testified that T-Mobile sought to merge with its smaller rival to increase scale and gain wireless spectrum, or airwaves that carry data, but denied the goal was to reduce competition. His testimony came on the second day of a trial that is expected to run until Dec. 20.  Attorneys for the states presented evidence on Tuesday from a T-Mobile board presentation in 2010, when the company first explored a deal with Sprint, that said the merger would have “potential to reduce price competition.” Höttges downplayed the presentation, saying it had been prepared by advisers and was not an official Deutsche Telekom document.  T-Mobile and Sprint have already received approval for the deal from the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Communications Commission, after the companies agreed to sell Sprint’s prepaid phone business and some spectrum to satellite TV provider Dish Network Corp. The companies argue that a stronger T-Mobile would result from the proposed takeover, making it better able to innovate and compete to reduce wireless prices. The case represents a break with the usual process of states coordinating with the federal government in reviewing mergers and generally coming to a joint conclusion. The states have argued that Dish is not a viable competitor in the wireless market that could replace Sprint as the fourth-largest carrier. On Tuesday, Glenn Pomerantz, an attorney representing California in the lawsuit, asked Höttges whether he was aware that Dish had repeatedly failed to build a network using its vast holdings of wireless spectrum.  Höttges testified that Dish founder and Chairman Charlie Ergen was “not easy to deal with,” but said Ergen was known for being a great entrepreneur and would have all the ingredients needed to build a network once the merger closed.

SoftBank was the most-traded stock on the main board and the jump in the stock lifted the information and communication sector sub-index 2.3%, making it the best-performing sector on the Tokyo bourse. However, more than two-thirds of the 33 sector sub-indexes were in negative territory, led by rubber products, electric and gas and construction. Overnight, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq inched to their second consecutive record closing highs, while the Dow closed flat, as Chinese officials said the deadly coronavirus epidemic could be contained by April. In contrast to the upbeat mood on Wall Street, many Tokyo-listed stocks were weighed down by worries of supply chain disruptions from the coronavirus outbreak in China that has killed more than 1,100 people. Nissan Motor Co lost 1.7% after the automaker temporarily halted production at its plant in Kyushu, southwestern Japan, due to supply shortage of parts from China. Taiko Pharmaceutical Co Ltd surged 18.2% to hit its daily limit after the drugmaker, which makes infection-control products, raised its operating profit forecast for the year ending March and announced a stock split plan. Elsewhere, chip-related companies attracted buying as the U.S. Philadelphia Semiconductor Index climbed 2% overnight, with Tokyo Electron Ltd rising 3.5% and Advantest Corp gaining 4.3%.

      "TOKYO (Reuters) - Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc (MUFG) (8306.T) on Tuesday became the latest Japanese firm to cancel a news conference due to fears over the escalating coronavirus outbreak, opting instead for a telephone conference with reporters. The decision by Japan’s biggest bank, following moves by other companies, reflects growing concern among companies about the virus after the government urged companies to recommend telecommuting and staggered shifts for workers. The government plan, approved a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, also urged people with symptoms of cold or fever to stay at home and asked event organizers to carefully consider whether to proceed with their plans. “We wanted to have this conference in person, but considered the coronavirus influence,” MUFG’s deputy president and incoming CEO Hironori Kamezawa said on the teleconference following the announcement about its investment in Singapore’s ride-hailing app Grab. Nissan Motor Co Ltd (7201.T) limited its launch event of a new car to a livestream, while Nomura Holdings Inc (8604.T) provided a teleconference option to reporters for a briefing about a new investment trust product. Japan has 160 domestic infections, apart from 691 on a ship in the port of Yokohama south of Tokyo, the British-registered Diamond Princess, since it docked on Feb. 3. On Tuesday, broadcaster NHK reported a fourth death among passengers. Rather than trying to contain the disease outright, authorities are seeking to slow its expansion and minimize deaths. Telecommuting, or working online or from home, would reduce the infection risk from people gathered in one place. Reporting by Takashi Umekawa; Editing by David Dolan and Louise Heavens\n",
